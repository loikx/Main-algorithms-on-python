### Sort algorithms
   #### Bubble sort 
      This is the simplest sorting algorithms.
      It's working with O(n^2) asymptotic.
      And this is in the bubble_sort_algorithm.py file.
      /sort algorithms/bubble_sort_algorithm.py
   #### Insertion sort
      This algorithm works with asymptotics O(n^2) like bubble sort algorithm.
      And this is in the insertion_sort_algorithm.py
      /sort algorithms/insertion_sort_algorithm.py
   #### Selection sort
      This algorithm works with asymptotics O(n^2) like the previous two algorithms.
      This is in the selection_sort_algorithm.py
      /sort algorithms/selection_sort_algorithm.py
   #### Quick sort
       This is the most interestong sort algorithm in my mind.
       Quick sort agorithm is working with O(n^2) asymptotic in worst
       But with O(n*logn) in average.
       And it's one of the most simple sort algorihms in my mind.
       This is in the quick_sort_algorihm.py
       /sort algorithms/quick_sort_algorithm.py
   #### Merge sort O
       This is difficult but fast sort algorihm.
       Merge sort algorithm is working with O(n*logn) asymptotic in worst.
       This is in the merge_sort_algorithm.py
       /sort algorithms/merge_sort_algoritm.py
   #### Tests file

   1) is palindrome
   2) principe of complementarity
   3) roman numerals to arabic
   4) roman numerals test
