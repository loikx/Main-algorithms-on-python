# Main-algorithms-on-python
This repository is contained ***all simple algorithms*** that **I know**.
I hope that it will help you to learn programming algorithms.
## [Sort algorithms](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/tree/main/sort%20algorithms)
### 1.[Bubble sort](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/blob/main/sort%20algorithms/bubble_sort_algorithm.py)
>This is the simplest sorting algorithm in my mind.
It's working with **O(n^2)** asymptotic.
And this is in the bubble_sort_algorithm.py file.
/sort algorithms/bubble_sort_algorithm.py
### 2.[Insertion sort](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/blob/main/sort%20algorithms/insertion_sort_algorithm.py)
>This algorithm works with asymptotic **O(n^2)** like bubble sort algorithm.
And this is in the insertion_sort_algorithm.py
/sort algorithms/insertion_sort_algorithm.py
### 3.[Selection sort](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/blob/main/sort%20algorithms/selection_sort_algorithm.py)
>This algorithm works with asymptotic **O(n^2)** like the previous two algorithms.
This is in the selection_sort_algorithm.py
/sort algorithms/selection_sort_algorithm.py
### 4.[Quick sort](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/blob/main/sort%20algorithms/quick_sort_algorithm.py)
>This is the most interesting sort algorithm in my mind.
Quick sort algorithm is working with **O(n^2)** asymptotic in worst
But with ***O(nlogn)*** in average.
And it's one of the most simple sort algorihms in my mind.
This is in the quick_sort_algorihm.py
/sort algorithms/quick_sort_algorithm.py
### 5.[Merge sort](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/blob/main/sort%20algorithms/merge_sort_algorithm.py)
>This is difficult but fast sort algorihm.
Merge sort algorithm is working with **O(nlogn)** asymptotic in worst.
This is in the merge_sort_algorithm.py
/sort algorithms/merge_sort_algorithm.py
### 6.[Tests file](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/blob/main/sort%20algorithms/tests_for_sort_algorithm.py)
>This file is contained test cases for sort algorithms.
/sort algorithms/tests_for_sort_algorithm.py
If you want to test sort algorithm that you write or me realized
>>1)Open tests_for_sort_algorithm.py file
>>>2)Import algorithm that you want to test
>>>>3)Change param sort_name in setUp method
>>>>>4)Run tests_for_sort_algorithm.py

## [String algorithms](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/tree/main/string%20algorithms)
### 1.[Is palindrome](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/blob/main/string%20algorithms/is_palindrome_string_algorithm.py)
>
### 2.[Principe of complementarity](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/blob/main/string%20algorithms/principle_of_complementarity.py)
>
### 3.[Roman numerals to arabic](https://github.com/loikx/Main-algorithms-on-python/blob/main/string%20algorithms/roman_numerals_to_arabic_algorithm.py)
